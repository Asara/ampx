SUMMARY
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I am a highly motivated and self driven technologist with a penchant for open
source software.  With a preference for Bash and Python, I have utilized my
experience and skills to provide support for multiple levels across the tech
stack.  I have hands on experience with a multitude of systems, including many
Windows Server editions (2003-2012R2).  I have a heavy preference for free and
open source software and have used Linux distributions such as Arch, Centos,
Debian, Gentoo, and Red Hat Enterprise Linux, and even Unixen systems including
FreeBSD, FreeNAS, and pfSense. Working with production systems has also allowed
me to become acquainted with a multitude of networking devices, including Citrix 
Netscaler, F5 switches, and many Cisco routers, and switches.  Storage services
such as RAID, SANs, and ZFS have been employed, manually and through vendors as
NetApp.  Virtualization has also been utilized, with both vendor specific
solutions such as Citrix XenServer and VMWare vSphere, open source hypervisors
such as oVirt (KVM), and RedHat Enterprise Virtualization have been utilized as
well.  FreeBSD jails have also been used for service isolation and security.
