SUMMARY
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I am a highly motivated and self-driven technologist with a penchant for open
source software.  With a preference for Bash and Python, I have utilized my
experience and skills to provide support for various organizations with varying
stacks.  With professional experience in both security and operations, I am able
to think broadly about problems. I enjoy new technologies and challenges always
hoping to learn more. Much of my time is spent on a black screen with white text
and as such this resume was written in Vim.
