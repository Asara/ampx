SUMMARY
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I am an incredibly technical individual who enjoys finding the marriage between
technology and real life problems.  Wearing many hats, including pure operations
as well as the more modern DevOps approach to infrastructure, I enjoy working in
fast paced environments with lots of moving parts.  This enjoyment has allowed
me to grow into a position where I am able to keep my hands on a lot of varying
technology, but also remain a master of my domain.
